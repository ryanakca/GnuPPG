First announced in http://blog.ryanak.ca/archives/planet-ubuntu/31 , these
utilities will:
 * Create a LUKS partition and copy your GnuPG homedir to it
 * Provide a wrapper for gpg that will automatically mount the partition and
   then, if the user wishes, automatically call the unmounter in X minutes.
 * The unmounter unmounts your gpg directory and copies your pubring to the
   mount target once the LUKS partition is unmounted. This permits you to do
   thing which don't require your private key without having to mount the
   encrypted partition
 * The LUKS partition can be on a USB flashdrive, an LVM lv, etc.
